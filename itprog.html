<h1>The Information Technology Program</h1>

<p>Information Technology or IT for short is a wide-reaching field focused on the usage, management, and creation of
    computers and other electronic systems. Students within the IT program here at ASU learn the ins and outs of such
    systems, including the hardware that they are based on, the software used to facilitate data management, and more. The
    IT program at Polytechnic also allows students to focus on various aspects of the industry, such as networking, cloud
    computing, and computer security.</p>
