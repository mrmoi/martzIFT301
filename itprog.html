<h1>The Information Technology Program</h1>

<p>Information Technology or IT for short is a wide-reaching field focused on the usage, management, and creation of
   computers and other electronic systems. Students within the IT program here at ASU learn the ins and outs of such
   systems, including the hardware that they are based on, the software used to facilitate data management, and more. The
   IT program at Polytechnic also allows students to focus on various aspects of the industry, such as networking, cloud
   computing, and computer security.</p>
