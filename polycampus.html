   same year. Today, the Polytechnic Campus is home to over 8,000 students studying in various technology-related
   fields. Students within the many different programs offered at the Polytechnic School are actively engaged in their
   fields of study, with research, software development, and more all taking place within on-campus facilities.</p>
